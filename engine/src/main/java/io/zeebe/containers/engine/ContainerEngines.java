/**
 * Collection of factories which create {@link ContainerEngine} instances based on either containers
 * ({@link ZeebeContainer}) or clusters ({@link ZeebeCluster}).
 *
 * <p>In each case, you can configure a grace period for which to wait for events. This may help you
 * deal with asynchronicity in your tests in a more succinct way. For example, instead of wrapping
 * an assertion in an `Awaitility` block, you could configure a grace period of 10 seconds and use
 * {@link io.camunda.zeebe.process.test.assertions.BpmnAssert} as you normally would. When the
 * assertion reaches the end of its stream, it will wait up to the grace period for new events
 * before giving up. This means, in our example, it would wait up to 10 seconds for new events. Once
 * a new event comes in during the grace period, that period is reset.
 *
 * <p>There are some differences with the normal {@link ZeebeTestEngine} implementations from the
 * zeebe-process-test project, notably in how we wait for idle/busy states. As there are no external
 * ways to do so with a real Zeebe engine, we define these states as:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>idle: no records were exported for at least 1 second since the call
 *   <li>busy: a new record was exported within the timeout since the call
 * </ul>
