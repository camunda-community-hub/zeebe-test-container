/**
 * Convenience class to help build Zeebe clusters.
 *
 * <p>The default configuration of this cluster is equivalent to starting a single {@link
 * ZeebeContainer} with all defaults, that is:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>one broker in the cluster with embedded gateway
 *   <li>one partition
 *   <li>replication factor of 1
 * </ul>
 *
 * By default, all nodes will use the {@link Network#SHARED} network as well.
 *
 * <p>Example usage for a cluster with 3 brokers, 3 partitions, replication factor 3, and all
 * embedded gateways:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *   final ZeebeCluster cluster = ZeebeCluster.builder()
 *      .withEmbeddedGateway(true)
 *      .withGatewaysCount(0)
 *      .withBrokersCount(3)
 *      .withReplicationFactor(3)
 *      .withPartitionsCount(3)
 *      .build();
 *  }
 *
 * <p>Example for the same as the above, but this time with one standalone gateway instead of
 * embedded gateways:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *   final ZeebeCluster cluster = ZeebeCluster.builder()
 *      .withEmbeddedGateway(false)
 *      .withGatewaysCount(1)
 *      .withBrokersCount(3)
 *      .withReplicationFactor(3)
 *      .withPartitionsCount(3)
 *      .build();
 *  }
 *
 * <p>Example for the same as the above, but with a mix of gateways:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *   final ZeebeCluster cluster = ZeebeCluster.builder()
 *      .withEmbeddedGateway(true)
 *      .withGatewaysCount(2)
 *      .withBrokersCount(3)
 *      .withReplicationFactor(3)
 *      .withPartitionsCount(3)
 *      .build();
 *  }
