/**
 * An example of using the debug exporter to extract events from the Zeebe log. Here we will simply
 * publish a message, which produces exactly two records (one command and one corresponding event).
 *
 * <p>The goal of the test is to showcase extracting the events, and not their correctness.
 *
 * <p>You will notice the test uses {@link Awaitility} - this is because a Zeebe broker, by design,
 * is asynchronous. As such, it takes a variable amount of time between publishing the message until
 * the records are exported. This is unfortunately necessary for now.
 *
 * <p>Also note that we start the {@link DebugReceiver} instance first, before the container. This
 * is required as we want to grab a random port, and only after starting the server can we know what
 * the port is exactly. If you wish to use a fix port, you can use {@link
 * DebugReceiver#DebugReceiver(Consumer, int)}, and pass the fixed port to {@link
 * io.zeebe.containers.ZeebeBrokerNode#withDebugExporter(int)}.
