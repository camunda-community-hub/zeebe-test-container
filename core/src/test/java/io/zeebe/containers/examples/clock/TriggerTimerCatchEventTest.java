/**
 * This example showcases how to test triggering a timer catch event by modifying the broker's actor
 * clock once the instance has been created. This is done by deploying a simple process which has a
 * start event, followed by a timer catch event, then a service task, and finally an end event. The
 * timer catch event is set to trigger one day from now. Additionally, a worker is set up from the
 * start to poll for the task immediately following the catch event.
 *
 * <p>Once deployed, the broker's actor clock is advanced by one day, and we can verify that one job
 * was activated by the worker - this means that the instance has passed the timer catch event.
