/**
 * A {@link ZeebeData} implementations which will mount a host path to the default Zeebe data path
 * for a broker container. See {@link ZeebeDefaults#getDefaultDataPath()} for more.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: keep in mind that files will be written using the container's user. This means, if you
 * run it as root, it may create files that your use cannot delete afterward.
 *
 * <p>To work around this, on Linux, make sure to start your container with your user ID and group
 * ID. e.g.:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * new ZeebeContainer()
 *   .withZeebeData(new ZeebeHostData("/tmp/data"))
 *   .withCreateCmdModifier(cmd -> cmd.withUser("1000:1000"))
 *   .start();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * Another option is to run a command on the container, before deleting everything, to change
 * permissions such that all files are writable by everyone.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: be careful when using this. It's not easy to remove a file system bind via the normal
 * Testcontainers API. So assume that if you attach this to a container, it's attached forever. If
 * you want to swap data over time, use a {@link ZeebeVolume}.
