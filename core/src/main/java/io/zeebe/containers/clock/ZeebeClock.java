/**
 * A high level API to interact with a node's actor clock.
 *
 * <p>You can use this to more easily test time based processes, such as triggering a broker to take
 * a snapshot, triggering a timeout on the gateway, or triggering a timer in a deployed process.
 *
 * <p>Be careful as changing the actor clock can trigger multiple things to occur at the same time.
 * Even though you only want to trigger your BPMN process's timer event, changing the clock can
 * trigger a Raft election as a side effect, causing temporary unavailability and introducing
 * uncertainty in your tests. When using this, try to ensure that the scope of the test (both in
 * terms of setup and assertions) is as narrow as possible.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: this is only compatible with Zeebe versions 1.3.x and above.
