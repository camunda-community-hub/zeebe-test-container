/**
 * A convenience class representing a one or more containers that form a Zeebe cluster.
 *
 * <p>It's recommended to use the {@link ZeebeClusterBuilder} to build one.
 *
 * <p>As the cluster is not started automatically, the containers can still be modified/configured
 * beforehand. Be aware however that the replication factor and the partitions count cannot be
 * modified: if you configure different values directly on your brokers, then you may run into
 * issues. Keep in mind as well that the gateways and brokers should be treated as immutable
 * collections.
 *
 * <p>Example usage:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * final class MyClusteredTest {
 *   private ZeebeCluster cluster;
 *   private Network network;
 *
 *   &#64;BeforeEach
 *   void beforeEach() {
 *     network = Network.newNetwork();
 *     cluster = ZeebeCluster.builder()
 *         .withBrokersCount(3)
 *         .withReplicationFactor(3)
 *         .withPartitionsCount(1)
 *         .useEmbeddedGateway(true)
 *         .withNetwork(network)
 *         .build();
 *   }
 *
 *   &#64;AfterEach
 *   void afterEach() {
 *     cluster.stop();
 *     network.close();
 *   }
 *
 *   &#64;Test
 *   void shouldConnectToCluster() {
 *     // given
 *     cluster.start();
 *
 *     // when
 *     final Topology topology;
 *     try (final CamundaClient client = cluster.newClientBuilder().build()) {
 *       topology = c.newTopologyRequest().send().join();
 *     }
 *
 *     // then
 *     assertThat(topology.getClusterSize()).isEqualTo(3);
 *   }
 * }
